## Installation Approaches
### Recommended: With Microsoft PowerToys & .NET6

- Download [Microsoft PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/powertoys/releases).
- Scroll to the latest release and download `PowerToys Setup-1234-x64.exe`.
- Run the installer to install PowerToys and .NET if needed.
- Download `utilities-cs-fd.exe` from the utilities-cs releases.

### Without PowerToys, With .NET6 Installed

- Check for .NET by running `dotnet --list-runtimes` in Command Prompt.
- Ensure "Microsoft.NetCoreApp 6.0" is listed. If not, install [.NET](https://dot.net).
- Download `utilities-cs-fd.exe` from the utilities-cs releases.

### Without PowerToys and .NET6

Alternatively, download the self-contained version `utilities-cs-sc.exe` from the utilities-cs releases (note: this version is larger and significantly slower at runtime).
